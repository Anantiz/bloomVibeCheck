## Saturday

### 13:30

First there was React, A library. Then came React-Native a Framework and Language, that happens to use JavaScript. And some time after a person decided to make "Expo" such that it would be easier to write Code for React-Native. And also we have Typescript that gets trasnpiled into JavaScript that gets embeded in the react Native Compiled app ...

Taxonomy is simpler than this smh.

"""
Development Tools: Expo provides a convenient mobile app and web interface for testing your application on real devices without going through the lengthy app store submission process for every test build.
"""
Well I guess APKs/IPAs can go get screwed. /j
Nah, that's clever actually.


### 14:30 Looked up the core Stack:

Expo coupled with Expo-Go and Metro Hot-reload is genuienly brilliant. Definitely a crucial and power full tool for fast mobile dev.

Expo: Run server on Pc -> QR-code with network ip -> Phones lookup download over Wi-fi -> Expo-go Loads the Js Package and runt it direclty;
Brilliant


### 15:16. Going for a 5min walk; Will dive directly in Expo afterwards

### 15:40 Back from the walk

Wow, adhd meds makes walking in the city much better, I don't find my city that ugly anymore 

### 17:00 Wanted to make an ArenaAllocator to Optimize MusicNotes for l2 cache. Ts/Js doesn't have pointers

I am now thinking about ending it all. Is life even worth living after learning this ?

### 17:17

Notes: 
/types/ are separates from OOP-style classes because we Separate Pure-data and Data-With-behavior.

"lib/ contains reusable, framework-agnostic logic" -> "Your piano roll engine should work the same in React Native, web, or even Node.jsYour piano roll engine should work the same in React Native, web, or even Node.js"
Makes sense

### 19:50 Wasted time like an idiot to make an Arena Allocator; Attacking Audio samples loading and Audio Playback

Hopefully Expo should handle all of this super cleanly.

### 22:00

ALTER ! Was ist "Zustand" jetz; Ich glaubte wir hatten EXPO, AAAAAA smk (Schuttle den Kopf)

### 22:25: Why Is there No FileName conventions ... :c I bet Rust/Python one is not the most adopted. Whatever

Also: THere is toooooooooooo much damn files Everywhere at once; That's so chaotic; wtf u mean 6K directories and 30K files ?


### 23:10: For tomorrow:
- Lookup more in details: useState, useEffect

### 23:50 Lost focus since 20mins ago; Going to sleep bye bye


## Sunday 8:40 Back at it
